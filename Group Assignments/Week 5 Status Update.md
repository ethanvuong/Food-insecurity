## Roles:
Stephanie: Content Developer- Conduct Research, Create Visualizations, and Develop related analysis.
Ethan: Content Developer- Conduct Research, Create Visualizations, and Develop related analysis.
Essentially, we have the same role because we evenly distribute the work between us. We will split the work by the data sets and goals we are looking to achieve.

## Status Update:
Our team is working well together. Since we have previous experience working with each other, we are able to communicate well regarding ideas and splitting the work evenly between us. We are both very passionate about this topic which helps us in staying motivated when creating visualizations and analyzing them. As we have a more solidified idea of our project now, we are able to come up with a more concrete thesis that we want to back up with our visualizations. Since we are both fairly new to code, it has taken some time for us to feel comfortable with the skills we are developing, but we are optimistic to create a great project by the end of the quarter.

## Data update:
We are using data from USDA that shows the average SNAP participation and total benefits each year. 
https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap
Using this data, we found that there was a trend of decreasing SNAP.  Additionally, we are using Census Data that depicts the SNAP usage/enrollment from each state in order to figure out which states have the highest usage SNAP.

We are also using Census Data that depicts the poverty levels of each state. By looking at the demographics of those who receive SNAP benefits, we will be able to determine how federal policies have affected the allotment and usage of SNAP benefits for people across the United States over time.


## Concerns:
### Major Concerns:
The Census data collection process seems like it may be more difficult than expected because it wouldn't let me download large sets of data, even when separating into states. We would either have to find a way to compile the data for our use or narrow the scope of our project.

### Minor Concerns:
* We are unclear or unsure if the result we get will be significant enough to make an arguable claim about SNAP in the U.S.
* We are unsure if citizenship status reported by the census is accurate, as some may be afraid of forced deportation, choosing not to respond.
* Would the frequent changes to government policy regarding federal aid greatly affect the accuracy of this project?
