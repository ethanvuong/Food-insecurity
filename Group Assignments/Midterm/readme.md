### Research Question
How does usage of SNAP differ across the US and what are some possible reasons?

### Why is it important?
According to Feeding America, 1 in 9 people in the United States struggle with hunger. This widespread struggle with food insecurity is something that often goes unnoticed in modern society, and the Coronavirus Pandemic has made this issue even more widespread. 

SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides benefits to help individuals and families purchase healthy food. We both work for the CalFresh Initiative at UCLA, the Californian version of SNAP, where we frequently interact with students who experience food insecurity first-hand. Having gained various perspectives about how food insecurity affects people from all backgrounds, this project will help to shed light to which communities and where in the U.S. food insecurity is most present. Each state is composed of various levels of each demographic group, demonstrating how there can be drastic backgrounds and needs of people can differ. Without more awareness, more people will suffer with food insecurity and it will undermine the tragic struggles that many individuals and families are faced with. 

### Spatial Scope
SNAP is a program that is implemented throughout the entire United States. While there are some states that have adopted a new name for this program, the United States government provides supplemental nutrition assistance to those who apply and qualify for aid. Due to the wide use of SNAP all over the country, the scope of our data project will be based on the entirety of the United States. Since we will focus on the states with the highest and lowest usage levels of SNAP, there will be a focus on those states and a comparison between them.

### Data sources
1. [Income and Benefits - States](https://covid19.census.gov/datasets/56f051341b4a40aa9aa5e2c33f85547a_2)
    * This data set was provided by the Census Bureau, where it examines the SNAP usage from each state, as well as the different ranges of income of those individuals with SNAP. We are taking the data on SNAP usage of each state so that we can see which states have the highest and lowest usage of SNAP, as well as the pattern of SNAP usage across the US. 
2. [ACS Poverty Status Variables - Boundaries](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0e468b75bca545ee8dc4b039cbb5aff6)
    *  This data was from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, where it showcased the population of states that are living below a certain poverty level, as well as their age demographics. We will use the data on the population of states living below the federal poverty line to create a bar chart and map visualization.
3. [Race in by State in the US](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=040|01000US&primary_geo_id=01000US)
    *  This data set provided by the US Census collects and summarizes demographic information within each state. We will use this data to create bar charts in order to compare demographic levels between states with low and high SNAP usage.
3. [Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (In 2019 Inflation-adjusted Dollars) by Receipt of Food Stamps/SNAP in the Past 12 Months](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B22008&geo_ids=040|01000US&primary_geo_id=01000US)
    *  This data set provided by the US Census collects and summarizes the median household income for households below and above the poverty line. These are categorized by those who receive SNAP benefits as well.
    
### Intended Analysis and Visualizations
[SNAP Usage Per State](https://github.com/ethanvuong/Food-insecurity/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Midterm/1%20SNAP%20Usage%20Per%20State.ipynb) 

Using the Income and Benefits data, we are able to create a bar chart that showcases the SNAP Usage Levels Per States in descending order from states with the highest percentage of households with SNAP to states with the lowest percentage of households with SNAP. From this, we are able to clearly indicate which states have the highest and lowest use of SNAP. Additionally, we are able to create a map visualization that showcases the same information. This is useful because you get to see how the different regions of the United States differ in SNAP usage and can be used for further comparisons with other map visualizations. 

[Poverty Rates per State ](https://github.com/ethanvuong/Food-insecurity/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Midterm/2%20Poverty%20Rates%20Per%20State.ipynb) 

Using the ACS data, we are able to create a bar chart that shows the states in descending order of poverty rates. From the chart, we can find the states highest and lowest poverty rates. We can also create a map visualization that showcases poverty rates across the states. This map visualization can be compared to the map visualization for SNAP usage per state to see if there’s a correlation among regions with SNAP usage and poverty rates. 

[Median Income ](https://github.com/ethanvuong/Food-insecurity/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Midterm/3%20Median%20Income.ipynb) 

Using the US Census data, we were able to create a map that depicts the status of households depending on their income level and whether they receive SNAP benefits or not. This allows us to determine if income status in certain states is a major factor in how many people depend of SNAP benefits. 

[Race in the United States ](https://github.com/ethanvuong/Food-insecurity/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Midterm/4%20Race%20in%20the%20United%20States.ipynb) 

Using the US Census data, we were able to create a bar chart for New Mexico and Wyoming, the states with the most and least enrollment in SNAP, comparing the population level of each race/ethnicity in the state. This allows us to understand how race impacts SNAP enrollment. 

### Insights we expect to gain
From this data analysis project, some insights we expect to gain are the effects of the food insecurity and SNAP benefits have on those who live in low income households. It will also provide insight as to which states have successful advocacy and implementation policies that help to mitigate the widespread struggle of food insecurity. Looking at the states with higher usage of SNAP, we will be able to determine what demographic categories demonstrate the most need and how states distribute accessibility. The maps will help to visually see which parts of the country use SNAP the most.
