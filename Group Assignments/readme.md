# DGT HUM 140 Group Project : Food Insecurity
### Research Question
Are there certain states that could better utilize the SNAP program? Why is it that these states have a lower utilization of the SNAP program despite how many could benefit from it?


### Why is it important?
According to Feeding America, 1 in 9 people in the United States struggle with hunger. This widespread stuggle with food insecurity is something that often goes unnoticed in modern society, and the Coronavirus Pandemic has made this issue even more widespread. We both work for the CalFresh Initiative at UCLA where we frequently interact with students who experience food insecurty first-hand. Having gained various perspectives about how food insecurity affects people from all backgrounds, this project will help to shed light to which communities and where in the U.S. food insecurity is most present. Without more awareness, more people will suffer with food insecurity and it will undermine the tragic struggles that many individuals and families are faced with. 

### Spatial Scope
SNAP is a program that is implemented throughout the entire United States. While there are some states that have adoped a new name for this program, the United States government provides supplemental nutrition assistance to those who apply and qualify for aid. Due to the wide use of SNAP all over the country, the scope of our data project will be based on the entirety of the United States. 

### Data sources
1. [Income and Benefits - States](https://covid19.census.gov/datasets/income-and-benefits-states/data?orderBy=FIPS_CODE&page=2)
    * This dataset covers information on total households in each state that are in certain income ranges, as well as the total households in each state that receive SNAP benefits. 
2. [SNAP Store Locations](https://usda-fns.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/USDA-FNS::snap-store-locations/data?geometry=153.412%2C-9.799%2C177.319%2C74.211)
    * This dataset provides compiled information about the stores that accept SNAP benefits. From store name, to zip code, to longitude and latitude, this dataset contains many different geographical variables that we can filter by. 

### Intended Analysis and Visualizations
Using these datasets, we want to see which states have a higher or lower percentage of people under a certain poverty line. Additionally, we also want to see which states have a higher or lower use of the SNAP program. We hope to compare the two ideas and find out which states may benefit from a more widespread promotion of SNAP. If we have the time, we want to explore the reasons of why these states have a lower number of SNAP households the large population in the state that could benefit from the program, comparing it to a state that has a high percentage of people under a certain poverty line but also has a high percentage of SNAP households. Some ideas of things to compare include demographics, number of SNAP store locations, and demographics. 

Some visualizations we imagine we will produce are map visualizations that indicate lower and higher percentages of people under a certain poverty line and use of the SNAP program. Following that, if we were to explore the reasons for lower utilization of SNAP, we can produce bar graphs to show comparison between the two states.
