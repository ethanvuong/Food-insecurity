# DGT HUM 140 Group Project : Food Insecurity
### Research Question
To what extent does the accessibilty and awareness of SNAP resources/benefits influence one's experience with food insecurity?
How do varying demographic categories demonstrate trends in populations who experience food insecurity?

### Why is it important?
According to Feeding America, 1 in 9 people in the United States struggle with hunger. This widespread stuggle with food insecurity is something that often goes unnoticed in modern society, and the Coronavirus Pandemic has made this issue even more widespread. We both work for the CalFresh Initiative at UCLA where we frequently interact with students who experience food insecurty first-hand. Having gained various perspectives about how food insecurity affects people from all backgrounds, this project will help to shed light to which communities and where in the U.S. food insecurity is most present. Without more awareness, more people will suffer with food insecurity and it will undermine the tragic struggles that many individuals and families are faced with. 

### Spatial Scope
SNAP is a program that is implemented throughout the entire United States. While there are some states that have adoped a new name for this program, the United States government provides supplemental nutrition assistance to those who apply and qualify for aid. Due to the wide use of SNAP all over the country, the scope of our data project will be based on the entirety of the United States.

### Intended Analysis and Visualizations

### Insights we expect to gain
From this data analysis project, some insights we expect to gain are the effects of the food insecurity and SNAP benefits have on those who live low income households. It will also provide insight as to which states have successful advocacy and implementation policies that help to mitigate the widespread struggle of food insecurity. Looking at the states with higher usage of SNAP, we will be able to determine what demographic categories demonstrate the most need and how states distribute accessibility. The maps will help to visually see which parts of the country use SNAP the most.
